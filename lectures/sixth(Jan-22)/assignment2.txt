(A) Implement a child window iterator for Container class.

(B) Implement setFocus() and hasFocus() methods. 
    Ensure that the following invariants hold:
        (1) Only one window has the active focus at any given point in time.
        (2) The AppWindow with the focus is never in STATE_MINIMIZED state.

(C) Give meaningful implementation for methods/functions that currently raise 
    NotImplementedError().

(D) Define two special Button instances with the following meaning. 
    When clicked, the OK button invokes accept() method on its 
    Container window. On the other hand, the Cancel button, when clicked, 
    invokes cancel() method on its Container window. The Container window 
    should remember whether it was canceled or OKyed.

(E) Define a class RadioButtonGroup that extends Container class. This new 
    class is designed to hold instances of a class named RadioButton. One 
    can choose only one from a group of radio buttons. By default, the first 
    element in the group is selected. A radio button is selected  when its 
    click() method is called.

(F) Carefully think about the Container class and its semantics. 
    What changes are required, if any, in its addChild() method, in order to 
    handle cases where one may attempt to add DialogBox instances etc.

(G) Enforce the following invariants:
    (1) There are no cycles in the window hierarchy. 
    (2) A child window MUST BE a part of only one parent window
    (3)
